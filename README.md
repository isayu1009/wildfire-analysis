# Wildfire Analysis Project

## Objective
Predict the duration of wildfires based on location, size, and cause.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Wildfire Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- 1.8 million records from the US

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub

## Key Steps
- Cleaned and filtered the data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Trained a Random Forest model


## Results
- Feature importance: Fire size and state had the most impact
- Visualizations showed seasonal trends in wildfires

## Next Steps
- Try a different model (XGBoost)
- Add interactive dashboard (Power BI)
